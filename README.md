    <img src="app/assets/images/button2.gif">
  </p>

  - Created custom animation for favorite button
  ```
  @keyframes spin {
    50% {
      -webkit-transform:rotateY(180deg);
      transform:rotateY(-180deg);
    }
  }

  .show-favorite-button:hover {
      animation-name:spin;
      animation-iteration-count:0.5;
      animation-duration:1.2s;
      animation-timing-function:ease-in;
      cursor: pointer;
  }
  ```
  - Created a Mini class for selectable thumbnails to allow for a user-friendly display of multiple pet images in the pet show page
  ```
  class Mini extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return(
            <div className='photo-thumbnail'>
                {this.props.photos.map((photoUrl, i) => (
                    <img key={i} src={photoUrl}
                    onClick={() => this.props.selectTab(i)}
                    className={this.props.selected === i ? "" : "not-selected-photo"}
                    />))}
            </div>
        )
    }
  }
  ```
